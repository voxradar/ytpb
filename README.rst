*Rewind to past moments in live streams and download or play excerpts*

Ytpb is a playback for YouTube live streams written in Python. It lets you go
back to past moments beyond the limits of the web player. You can keep selected
moments by downloading excerpts or play them instantly in your video player via
MPEG-DASH.

Check out also `mpv-ytpb <https://github.com/xymaxim/mpv-ytpb>`__ to play and
rewind live streams interactively without leaving a player.

Installation
************

Ytpb requires Python 3.11 or higher and has been `tested
<https://github.com/xymaxim/ytpb/actions/workflows/ci.yml>`__ on Linux, macOS,
and Windows. Also, it needs the recent version of `FFmpeg
<https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`__ to be installed.

Installing from PyPI
====================

When you have all required dependencies, you can install Ytpb via `pipx
<https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>`_::

  $ pipx install ytpb

To upgrade to the newer version, do::

  $ pipx upgrade ytpb

Windows binaries
================

For Windows, pre-built binaries are available: check `releases
<https://github.com/xymaxim/ytpb/releases>`__ on GitHub. Make sure to `add
<https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows>`__ the ``ffmpeg.exe`` file
to your system path or place it in the folder next to the Ytpb binary. Now
you're ready to use Ytpb in Terminal: type commands, not double-click.
