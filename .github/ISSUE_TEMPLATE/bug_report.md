Make sure to read [this](https://ytpb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#reporting-a-problem) before. When writing a bug report, please:

- Describe in details the problem you encountered
- Include the exact command line used: `ytpb download ...`
- Attach the full command line output. The preferred way is to use the `--report` option: `$ ytpb --report COMMAND ...`, which produces the `ytpb-yyyymmdd-HHMMSS.log` log file
